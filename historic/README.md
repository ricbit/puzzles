# Historic information

Some historic information about puzzles in Brazil. Most of the information was researched and released to the public by Sérgio Barcellos Ximenes, puzzle historian.

## Torto

The original author of Torto is currently unknown. A search on the brazilian trademark office revealed that the "Torto" trademark was first registered by Ediouro on 1977-06-01, as seen on [Torto INPI search](torto-inpi.pdf). The earliest instance found so far was published on "Coquetel Total #1", dated September 1977. Given that it's the first issue, it's possible this is the very first Torto. We have scans of [the cover](coquetel-total-cover.pdf) and of [the Torto puzzle](coquetel-total-torto.pdf). There is no answer page: at the time, the answers were provided only on the following edition.

## Logomania

While we don't know the author of Torto yet, we have some information on its probable origin. Henrique Ramos, a puzzle author active at the time, reported that Torto was inspired by "Logomania", a puzzle created by Luiz Carlos Bravo and published on the newspaper "O Globo". We have a scan of [the very first Logomania](logomania.pdf), published on 1974-08-25. Logomania rules are somewhat different from Torto: it doesn't have a grid, and all words are required to use the letter in the big boldface.

## Word search

Most texts will credit the invention of Word Search to Norman E. Gibat in 1968. However, we have found prior art in the brazilian magazine "Almanaque de Seleções Recreativas", dated from 1966. On page 43, there is a puzzle called "Viajando" ("Travelling"), created by Henrique Ramos. This puzzle calls for the names of 12 countries in a word grid, following exactly the same rules as the classic word search: words can be found on horizontal, vertical, diagonals, and backwards. (The 12 countries I found were *Arabia, Japão, Peru, Uruguai, Panama, Chipre, Grecia, Siria, França, Palau, Gana and Irland(sp?a)*)

From this magazine, we have scans of [the cover](Almanaque-cover.jpg), [the editorial](Almanaque-address.jpg), and of [the puzzle Viajando itself](Almanaque-wordsearch.jpg).
